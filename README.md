# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

I'll build a simple neural network in PyTorch and train it to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Training a classifier on the MNIST dataset can be regarded as the hello world of image recognition. Steps to create the neural network are as follows: 

1) Set up the Environment

2) Prepare the Dataset

3) Build the Network

4) Train the Model

5) Evaluate the Model's Performance



PS: MNIST contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits: 60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale, 28x28 pixels, and centered to reduce preprocessing and get started quicker.
